# E-Waste 3D Printer
In 2009, discarded TVs, computers, peripherals (including printers, scanners, fax machines) mice, keyboards, and cell phones totaled about 2.37 million short tons. Most of our e-waste ends up in landfills—mostly in the developing world—where toxic metals leach into the environment. This open source project aims to convert some of that e-waste into usable 3D printers. 
## Software
E-Waste 3D Printer uses python and FreeCAD to 3D model printable parts for the construction of more 3D printers. Through globalVars.py dimensions of procured e-waste are turned into customized 3D models. E-Waste 3D Printer's software depends on FreeCAD's python scripting API. FreeCAD can be found [here](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Download "Download FreeCAD").
## Installation
After downloading the most recent release of E-Waste 3D Printer, three configurations must be made that are machine specific. After configuring each option, make sure to uncomment the line by removing the “#”. Moreover, make sure to use forward slashes like this / and not back slashes like this \ . 

1. Change the following line in makePrinter.py to locate the folder containing FreeCAD's "FreeCAD.so" or "FreeCAD.dll" file. 
```
sys.path.append("/Applications/FreeCAD.app/Contents/lib")
```
For Windows users it is in the .../FreeCAD 0.xx/bin or .../FreeCAD 0.xx/lib folder
For Mac users it is inside the FreeCAD.app file. Use "show package contents" to locate it. .../FreeCAD.app/Contents/lib
For Linux users (debian baesd) it is sys.path.append('/usr/lib/freecad/lib')


2. Next, change the following line in makePrinter.py to locate the folder containing the printer building scripts.
```
sys.path.append("/Path/To/ewaste3Dprinter")
```
3. Finally, change the output directory in globalVars.py. This is where your 3D files will be stored after they are generated.
```
printerDir = "/Path/To/Storage/"
```

## Tests
To begin creating a printer from the default options, open FreeCAD. Next, select “Macros ...” from the “Macro” menu.

Next, select the folder where “makePrinter.py” is stored.

Finally, select “makePrinter.py” for the available options. After that, hit “Execute” to create a printer.

If everything was installed correctly, you should now have something that looks like this:

Remember, it might take a while for your printer to be modeled. Please be patient.
